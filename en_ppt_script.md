## 👋 自我介绍选项

### **简短版本 (推荐)**
已包含在Slide 1中 - 身份、背景、目标

### 🎯 Slide 1 - Opening

> "Hi John, thanks for taking the time to meet with me. I'm a volunteer developer from your community, and I've built three tools that solve some real user problems. I'd love to show you what I've created and see if there might be opportunities to work together.
>
> **[暂停，观察反应]**
>
> Does that sound interesting? Let me show you what I found in the community..."

---

### 💡 Slide 2 - Problem Discovery

> "So I noticed users were struggling with three main things. First, checking Season 1 fees - you know that existing tool that takes forever to load? Users were really frustrated with it. Second, there was nothing for Season 2 tracking at all. And third, people wanted to find profitable wallets in hot pools, but no tools existed for that.
>
> I thought, why not build something that actually works?
>
> **[暂停]** Any questions about these pain points?
>
> **[过渡]** So here's what I ended up building..."

---

### 🎯 Slide 3 - Tool Overview

> "So I built three tools. There's a Season 2 tracker - actually the first and only one out there. Then a profitable wallet tracker that digs into hot pools to find the addresses that are actually making money. And an S1 fees checker that's way faster than what exists now.
>
> You can see the links here if you want to try them out later.
>
> **[暂停]** What do you think about this approach? Any of these particularly interesting to you?
>
> **[过渡]** Let me dive deeper into the S2 tracker first..."

---

### ⚡ Slide 4 - S2 Tool Deep Dive

> "Let me explain what the S2 tracker is and why it matters. It's a dedicated Season 2 fees tracking tool - the first and only one in the market.
>
> The problem it solves is simple: users participating in Season 2 want to know how much they've earned toward potential airdrops, but there was no way to check this.
>
> Who does it serve? Primarily airdrop hunters and users participating in the Season 2 campaign. They can see their progress, understand how close they are to their goals, and stay motivated to continue participating.
>
> **[暂停]** This kind of transparency is crucial for campaign engagement, right? Does this approach make sense for keeping users motivated?
>
> **[过渡]** Now let me show you the profitable wallet tracker, which serves a completely different user need..."

---

### 💰 Slide 5 - Other Two Tools

> "The profitable wallet tracker is something completely different. It's a tool that mines profitable addresses from hot liquidity pools.
>
> The problem it solves is much more intuitive than just posting PNL screenshots on X. Users can see in real-time which pools are actually making money, what strategies are working, and how much investment is generating what returns.
>
> Who does it serve? Three types of users: **Beginners** get a clear, visual understanding of what pools are profitable, lowering the barrier to entry. **Intermediate users** can do copy trading through lpagent integration. **Advanced users** can study successful strategies and apply them to their own trading.
>
> The S1 checker is a faster, more reliable alternative to the existing slow tool.
>
> **[暂停]** The profitable wallet concept is pretty powerful for user onboarding, right? What's your take on making LP strategies more accessible?
>
> **[过渡]** So that's what I built. Let me show you how this compares to what's out there..."

---

### 🏆 Slide 6 - Competitive Advantage

> "Let me show you a direct comparison with the existing S1 tool. The current community S1 checker has serious issues - 30+ minute loading times, poor user experience, and requires heavy infrastructure.
>
> My S1 checker offers instant results, cost-effective development using free platforms, reliable performance, and positive user reception. It's a direct improvement on the same functionality.
>
> **[暂停]** This kind of performance improvement is significant for user experience, right?
>
> **[过渡]** Now, let me talk about the actual impact this has had..."

---

### 📈 Slide 7 - Real Impact

> "The impact has been pretty good. Users are happy with them, it shows the community is innovative and capable, and honestly, you're getting all this development work for free. It's a win-win situation.
>
> **[暂停]** From your perspective, what kind of impact matters most? User satisfaction? Cost savings?
>
> **[过渡]** Let me break down the value proposition for the team..."

---

### 🎯 Slide 8 - Core Value

> "From your perspective, this brings real value - more active users, better retention, good community reputation, and zero development costs. Plus it shows what the community can achieve when motivated.
>
> **[暂停]** Which of these benefits resonates most with your current priorities?
>
> **[过渡]** So here's what I'm thinking in terms of next steps..."

---

### 🤝 Slide 8 - Seeking Support

> "So I'd love some official recognition for these tools, maybe help promoting them. If you see value in scaling them up, some support for better infrastructure would be great. And I'm definitely interested in collaborating on more community projects. Basically, I want to work more closely with the team.
>
> **[暂停]** What are your thoughts on this? Does any of this sound feasible from your end?
>
> **[过渡]** Let me wrap this up..."

---

### 💖 Slide 9 - Conclusion

> "So that's basically it - three tools that solve real problems, users are happy, and it doesn't cost you anything. I'm excited about the possibility of working more closely with the team.
>

## 🤔 预期问题及建议回答

### 🤝 **关于合作期望**

**Q1: "你具体希望得到什么样的官方支持？"**
```
A: "Four main areas: 1) Official recognition through appropriate channels, 2) If tools show value, enhancement support to improve stability and real-time capabilities - this could include funding incentives or technical support, 3) Opportunities to participate in more community initiatives, 4) Long-term partnership to drive ecosystem growth together."
```

**Q2: "你需要多少资金支持？"**
```
A: "I'm not asking for specific amounts upfront. My approach is to first demonstrate value with these free tools. If Meteora sees potential, we can discuss appropriate support levels - whether that's funding for better infrastructure, technical resources, or other forms of partnership that benefit the ecosystem."
```

**Q3: "为什么需要官方支持？现在的免费方案不是工作得很好吗？"**
```
A: "The free platform approach proves the concept and delivers immediate value. However, if Meteora wants to scale these tools for broader community use, enhance real-time capabilities, or improve system reliability, official support would enable significant upgrades while maintaining the cost-effective approach."
```

### 📊 **关于数据和用户量**

**Q4: "你能提供具体的用户数据吗？DAU、MAU是多少？"**
```
A: "I want to be transparent - as an independent developer using free platforms, I haven't implemented comprehensive analytics systems. However, I can share that the tools have consistent usage patterns and positive community feedback. With official support, I'd be happy to implement proper tracking systems."
```

**Q5: "没有数据怎么证明工具的价值？"**
```
A: "That's a fair question. While I don't have quantitative metrics, the qualitative evidence is strong - users continue to use the tools, provide positive feedback, and the S2 tool fills a complete market gap. The value is also in cost savings - Meteora gets these solutions at zero cost."
```

### 🔧 **关于技术实现**

**Q6: "T-1数据更新够实时吗？用户会不会不满意？"**
```
A: "For most use cases, T-1 updates are sufficient. Users typically check their earnings periodically, not in real-time. However, with official support, I could upgrade to more robust infrastructure that enables real-time or near real-time updates."
```

**Q7: "免费平台的可靠性如何保证？"**
```
A: "I've chosen reliable free platforms with good uptime records. The architecture is designed to be resilient. If there are reliability concerns, this is exactly where official support could help - upgrading to enterprise-grade infrastructure while maintaining cost efficiency."
